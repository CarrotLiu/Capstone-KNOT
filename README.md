# Capstone-KNOT
## Introduction To The Project
KNOT结, a web application, is the digital component of my capstone "KNOT 结". Users can record and send intimate voice messages to their close ones and access the archive via a physical bracelet made by themselves. The voices are archived as traditional Chinese "knots" to echo the ancient ways of recording family events among minority groups.
