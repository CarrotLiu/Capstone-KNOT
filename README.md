# Capstone-KNOT
KNOT web app is the digital component of my capstone "KNOT ç»“". Users can record and send intimate voice messages to their close people and access the archive via a physical bracelet made by themselves. The voices are archived as traditional Chinese "knots" to echo the ancient ways of recording family events among minority groups.
